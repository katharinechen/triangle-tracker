#Triangle Tracker 

##About
This project was completed by Katharine Chen and [Sergii Mertsalov](https://github.com/Mind1992) on Week#2, Day#2 as part of the [Epicodus Code School](www.epicodus.com)'s "Learn how to Program" [curriculum](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/triangle-tracker-shipping-rate-calculator). 

##Description 
The goal of this project is to create a program that identify valid and invalid triangles. Valid triangles will be appropriately categorized and appended using JQuery in the appropriate section of the webpage. 

##Functionality
* If a user enters an invalid triangle, an alert would pop up when they tried to submit a form.
* If a user types in a valid triangle, it will automatically sort into the right triangle category.
